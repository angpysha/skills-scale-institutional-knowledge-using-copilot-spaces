# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team (PM, PdM, Scrum Master, Business Analyst)
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria (Product Manager and Business Analyst)
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points) with Developers and Scrum Master
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD) including UX and QA acceptance criteria
5. Identify dependencies and integration points (DevOps Engineer input for infrastructure deps)
6. Create release plan and milestone map (PM coordinates with DevOps and Scrum Master)
